				<figcaption> <span>Lidhja e Prizrenit</span> <br> The League of Prizren, was an Albanian political organization founded on January 5, 1877 but officially on June 10, 1878 in the old town of Prizren, in the Kosova Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. The League of Prizren was created by a group of Albanian intellectuals to resist partition among neighbouring Balkan states and to assert an Albanian national consciousness by uniting Albanians into a unitary linguistic and cultural nation. During the meeting in Prizren a kararname was signed by 47 beys in June 18, 1878. The document represented an initial position, mainly supported by landlords and individuals related to the Ottoman administration.

				<figcaption><span>Kalaja e Artanes </span><br> The fortress is located in the municipality of Artana, about 30-35 km west of Gjilan and about 39 kilometers south-east of Prishtina.  The fortress was built in the early 14th century to protect gold, silver, iron and lead mines which were abundant throughout the area. Novo Brdo was famous for its silver. Together with the castles of Prizrenac, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) to the southwest, and Prilepac, 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) to the southeast, which guard access roads to the fortress, Novo Brdo helped form a defensive complex overlooking the lucrative mining operations.

The National Theatre in Pristina, Pristina International Airport and the Olympic Stadium Adem Jashari have been named after him.
