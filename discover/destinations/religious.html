				<figcaption><span>Katedralja Nena Tereze</span> <br> The Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa in Pristina is a Roman Catholic cathedral being constructed in Pristina, Kosovo. In 2007, the Government of Kosovo approved plans for the building. The foundation was ceremonially laid by former President of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, himself a Muslim. It was inaugurated on 26 August 2010, the hundredth anniversary of her birthday, before construction was completed.[3] Its construction, begun in 2011, sparked controversy in Muslim circles where it was seen as outsized considering the small number of Catholics in the area

				<figcaption><span>Tyrbja e Sulltan Muratit </span><br> The Tomb of Sultan Murad is a mausoleum dedicated to the Ottoman Sultan Murad I located in Kosovo, in the Prishtina District. It was mentioned by Evliya Çelebi in 1660. Murad I (nicknamed Hüdavendigâr, meaning the "God-liked one" or the "sovereign" in this context) was killed in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. His internal organs were buried in Kosovo Polje and remain to this day in the tomb at the site. The tomb has gained a religious significance for the local Muslims. Murad's other remains were taken to Bursa, his Anatolian capital city, and buried there in his second tomb at the Hüdavendigâr complex in Bursa.
