								The ancient Illyrians are known as the Albanian predecessors and the initial inhabitants on the Balkan Peninsula which were followed by the Slavs in the 6th and 7th centuries. The country of Kosovo was ruled by Bulgaria from the 9th century up until the Serbs took control in the 12th century. In 1389, the Ottoman Empire Turks defeated the Serbs and absorbed Kosovo. Following the Ottoman Turks defeat, the Ottoman Empire ruled centuries until year 1913 which was when Serbia regained control over Kosovo as it became part of the Yugoslavia Federation.

					<br/>
					<div  class="divhidden">
						<p>Throughout the 1990’s, armed unrest and ethnic tension rose as a result of the escalated nationalism among the division of Yugoslavia and the suspension of the Kosovo Assembly by Serbia. Ibrahim Rugova was elected as president of the republic that was self-proclaimed by the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in disobedience with the Serbian authorities<br />
						1998 – Open clash and conflict took place between the Serbian Police and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) a group which was established to fight the Serbian regime &#8211; requiring and demanding Kosovo to separate from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and gain its freedom.<br />
						1998 &#8211; September – An ultimatum to bring an end to the attacks on Kosovo Albanians was given by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to Milosevic.<br />
						1999 &#8211; NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia took place between the period of March 24 and June 10, 1999, for the duration of which NATO attacked Serbia and Albanian paramilitaries the aggression with the Yugoslav forces. At that time an enormous displacement of approximately 1 million people of the Kosovar population took place.<br />
						1999 –Milosevic surrendered and accepted the peace conditions on June 3rd, 1999 where following this action, KFOR –a NATO force, started entering Kosovo.

				<div  class="divhidden">
					<p>Throughout the Balkan Wars in 1912, the majority of Kosovo was taken over by the Serbian Kingdom apart from the Dukagjini area which was taken over by the Montenegrin Kingdom.<br />
					As the Communist regime of Tito was established, Kosovo was identified and stated as an autonomous region of the country of Serbia in year 1946 and later in 1963 became an autonomous province.<br />
					Many patriots were killed end imprisoned by the Communist government and such acts were culminated by the massacre of Tivar in which around 3000-4000 Kosovars were executed by machine-guns. As the Yugoslavia constitution was passed in 1974, Kosovo was virtually self-governed.  As a result, all through the 1980’s, tensions among the Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo area arose. The autonomy of Kosovo was then severely condensed by the Serbia-wide referendum in 1989.</p>

				<p>The Ottoman Turks formed the Vilayet of Kosovo to be one of the Ottoman territories in addition to the bringing of Islam into the area. At the time the Ottoman Turks had absolute power in Kosovo and they ruled the region for approximately 500 years where numerous Slav acknowledged Islam and served under the rules of the Ottoman Turks.<br />
				One of the four vilayets with Albanians in 1878 formed the League of Prizren and was known as the Vilayet of Kosovo with the purpose of resisting the Ottoman rules and other invasions by newly-emerging nations in the Balkans. Coincidentally though, Prizren is today one of the most Turk-related and influenced cities of Kosovo.</p>

			<p>The Kosovo area was located in the eastern side of Illyria bordering on Thrace in century 4 BC. At that point in time, Kosovo was inhabited by the Thraco-Illyrian tribes of Dardania. In the distant ancient past, Dardania was the name of Kosovo’s region and was formed as a part of the Roman province of Moesia.  The Balkans area was captivated within the Byzantine Empire in the 850’s after 6th and 7th century migrations took place in the area. The control of the Byzantine was then reasserted by Emperor Basil II who was known to be very forceful and powerful. Kosovo remained in the Serbian Empire from 1346 to 1371 as it was immersed into Serbia towards the end of the 12th century. The Serbian Prince army was defeated by the Ottoman Turks in the well-known Battle of Kosovo in 1389; the Ottoman Turks finally took control over the territory of Kosovo in the year of 1455. </p>
